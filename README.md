## Discord Observer

This is a bot that, after a specific amount of days, sends a message, that the user has been on the guild for that specific amount of days.
This can come in handy, if you have a guest role, and after for example two weeks the user can be promoted to a member.

# config.py - Configuring the bot

You can change how long a user needs to be on the guild.

You can do that with the DAYS variable.

You can change for which roles the bot should look out, so for example it should only look for users with the guest role, not for users that are already a member.

You can do that with the ROLES_TO_LOOK_OUT variable.

You can change which roles the user should receive after the user has been on the guild for the days specified.

You can do that with the ROLES_TO_GIVE variable.
